Non-PXE (Tilera) baremetal Instance Creation
======

1) A user requests a baremetal instance.
e.g. euca-run-instances -t tp64.8x8 ami-CCC

2) nova-scheduler selects a baremetal nova-compute.
e.g. nova-compute with a special nova.conf (compute_driver = nova.virt.baremetal.driver.BareMetalDriver, instance_type_extra_specs=cpu_arch"x86_64)

3) The bare-metal nova-compute selects a bare-metal node from its pool based on hardware resources and the instance type (# of cpus, memory, HDDs).

4) The kernel is prepared and then NFS/TFTP is configured for the bare-metal nodes. 

5) The baremetal nova-compute powers on the baremetal host thorough PDU(Power Distribution Unit).

6) The images are deployed to bare-metal nodes. nova-compute mounts AMI into NFS directory or passes AMI to the bare-metal node's local disk.

7) The bare-metal node is rebooted.

8) The bare-metal node is booted up by the user specified kernel and its NFS disk.

9) Done.
